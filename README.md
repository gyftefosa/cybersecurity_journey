# My Cybersecurity Journey

## Introduction
Hi! I'm Asuquo Gift Efosa, a beginner in cybersecurity. I'm NIgerian, I studied Industrial Physics in the University of Benin, graduated in 2023. The main thing that made me interested in cybersecurity is my disdain for cybercrimes. Living in Nigeria, a society where cybercrimes is basically normalized, made me realize the dangers of it and how easy it is for people to be victims of cybercriminals. I had a drive to help people protect themselves from cybercrimes and cybercriminals  even before I knew what the term 'cybersecurity' meant. So, when I heard about cybersecurity and started reading about it, it was a no-brainer, I knew immediately that this is the fiels I want to specialize in. My motivation is the constant need for cyber protection and the growing need for security professionals.
## My Journey
After establishing that I wanted to be a security professional, the next step was to start learning. I started taking self-paced courses, reading every artcle I could find but I also knew that I would need a program that would totally commit to teaching me and pushing me to to get better and more grounded in cybersecurity. So, I decided to register for Altschool Cybersecurity Program, a one year diploma that teaches depths of cybersecurity. What excites me about cybersecurity is the dynamism of the field. The landscape is always changing, with new technologies, emerging threats, and evolving attack tactics. 
My long-term goal is to become a leading professional in the incident response and forensics field, I'd love to be an incident responder. I'm also interested in Government, Risk, and Compliance field. My long term goals also includes being an advocate for cybersecurity awareness.
